# aiter mha kernel

this is an example how to benchmark aiter mha fwd/bwd kernel through c++ API: `aiter::mha_fwd`, `aiter::mha_fwd_splitkv`, `aiter::mha_bwd`.

## build and run
We provide a simple script `build_mha.sh` to build the device library as well as a simple executable:
```
# this will build fwd+bwd
bash build_mha.sh

# this will build fwd only
bash build_mha.sh fwd

# this will build bwd only
bash build_mha.sh bwd
```
Device library `libmha_fwd.so` and `libmha_bwd.so` will be built under current folder, and corresponding executables `benchmark_mha_fwd` and/or `benchmark_mha_bwd` will also be built. You can type `./benchmark_mha_fwd -?` to list all the supported arguments. You can also refer to the `smoke_test_*` script under this folder for a list of quick test.

## how to build/link aiter mha in your c++ project
We recommend you download the source code of `aiter` and put it under the `3rdparty` submodule folder of your project (you don't need to install `aiter`). We use a way simliar to [cpp_extension](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/utils/cpp_extension.py) to build the device kernel library without `torch` dependency (you don't need to install `torch`), so it's easy to embed `aiter` into other project.

Basically the build process will be similiar to that inside `build_mha.sh` script.

First, you need to build the device kernel into a `so`, which is done by a python `compile.py` inside this folder.
```
python3 compile.py
```
you can also call this python script from different directory, the generated `.so` will always under current directory.

Second, link the `.so` into your executable and compile. You need specify the correct path through `-L` inorder to link to the device lib. You also need to specify the include directory through `-I`, for this example you need set `$TOP_DIR/csrc/include` for the `aiter` API header, and the dependent ck header `$TOP_DIR/3rdparty/composable_kernel/include` and `$TOP_DIR/3rdparty/composable_kernel/example/ck_tile/01_fmha/`. Please refer to `build_mha.sh` for detailed command
